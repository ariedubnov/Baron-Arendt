{"name":"Baron-Arendt","tagline":"Salo W. Baron - Hannah Arendt correspondence","body":"# From German-Jewish Refugee to an American Public Intellectual? \r\n## Hannah Arendt, Salo W. Baron & the postwar transformation of the Jewish Republic of Letters\r\n\r\nThere are three interrelated aims to the proposed research project: \r\n\r\n1.  to utilize some of the innovative research tools developed in recent years in Digital Humanities to reconstruct, analyze, and visualize the social and intellectual networks and long-distance circulation of ideas for the study of a particular historical case – the intellectual milieu and evolving network of the German-Jewish political philosopher Hannah Arendt (1906–1975), roughly between 1936 and 1946; \r\n\r\n1.  to study Arendt’s exact role and activities at the Jewish Cultural Reconstruction Inc. (JCR), an under-studied yet crucial episode in Arendt’s life, and to evaluate to what extent this experience, alongside the postwar debate on restitution claims had shaped her postwar thinking on Jewish collectivity and politics; \r\n\r\n1.  to study her relationship with the Galicia-born Jewish-American historian Salo Wittmayer Baron (1895–1989), the JCR’s director and later a life-long friend, and to asses to what extent he played a vital role as a ‘cultural gate’, providing Arendt with support, links and access to new American-Jewish intellectual and social milieux.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe combination of all three aims will not only allow us to reassess the development of Arendt’s political philosophy in a more historically contextualized way, but also to allocate her within a larger process of recreation of a Jewish Republic of Letters in the postwar world. The recent digitization of Arendt’s papers, including a massive body of her correspondence, alongside the opening of the Baron Papers and the JCR archives, provides new and exciting opportunities for research. Using some of the technologies that were developed, tested and proven successful at Stanford University’s Center for Visual and Textual Analysis, we can reconstruct much more carefully and accurately the volume, direction and shape of scholarly outreach and thereby better understand the process by which Arendt slowly but steadily transcended her personal pariah status and became part of a new intellectual network consisting of non-German yet still predominantly Jewish circle of New York intellectuals. Alongside the reassessment of a particular life story and philosophy, there is also a general lesson to be learned from the study. On the one hand, we would like to capture a crucial phase of transition in Arendt’s life and to see how she began to overcome exile, rubbing shoulders with a new circle of Cold War intellectuals, and thereby also gaining access to a new, much wider audience and scholarly network. On the other hand, we would like to go beyond the individual story, to zoom-out and see Arendt as part of the larger trans-local intellectual community she was a member of, and thus make headways towards a new research paradigm, that will bring the term “Republic of letters” into the forefront in order to offer a larger, synoptic view of twentieth century Jewish and non-Jewish intellectual life. As the historian Dan Diner argued recently, we are currently not equipped with the proper categories, notions, and concepts to understand and interpret the diverse histories of Jews during the cataclysmic twentieth century, and the field is thirsty for greater conceptual sharpness. We aim to address this challenge, to use network theory and Digital Humanities and to produce a model for historical analysis more sensitive to the transnational dimensions of Jewish and intellectual life. \r\n\r\nArchival Source: [The Baron Papers] (http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft509nb07b/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
